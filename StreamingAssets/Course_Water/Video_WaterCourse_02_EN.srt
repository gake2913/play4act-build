1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,784
My son, eat your plate, it's going to get 
cold. 

2
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:07,532
I know, but stomach hurts. 

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,875
Come on, eat so you'll be strong and 
healthy. 

4
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,999
- Busy. 
- Andrés, hurry up! 

5
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:40,671
- Andrés, no! 
- We're busy! 

6
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:52,765
Every time, you get a tummy ache at the 
same time. 

7
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:55,099
It must be because of what we've eaten. 

8
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:58,290
Dad cooked yesterday. 
Maybe that's it. 

9
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:02,529
Hello. 

10
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:05,021
Hi. 
What's wrong with your dad? 

11
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:07,107
He's sick with a stomach ache. 

12
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:10,802
Him too? Well, he didn't eat any of our 
dad's food. 

13
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,481
No, I think it's because of the water we 
drink. 

14
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:15,160
Don't you boil it? 

15
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:18,216
Yes, but sometimes it's not enough. 
Isn't anyone ill at home? 

16
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,286
Yes, both of us. 
And I've got mushrooms on my skin. 

17
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:22,342
Show me. 

18
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:29,759
If you like, we can go and look at your 
water. 

19
00:01:40,732 --> 00:01:44,302
It looks a bit dirty, but it's the usual. 

20
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,302
Do you think the water's like that all 
over town? 

21
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:51,232
I don't know. Maybe it's just our 
neighbourhood. 
Maybe it's just our neighbourhood. 

22
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:53,075
We have to get down to the city. 

23
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,279
It'll be funny to see everyone running to 
the toilet. 

24
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:41,744
In the school laboratory, we use this 
magnifying glass to see smaller objects. 

25
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:43,947
Can you see germs? 

26
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:47,103
No, but we can see dirt, look. 

27
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:58,203
Oh, even the plants in the city get better 
water than we do.
