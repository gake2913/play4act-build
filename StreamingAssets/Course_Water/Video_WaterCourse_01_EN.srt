1
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:15,716
Son, nothing has grown... 

2
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:38,506
Winter is barely over and the well has 
already dried up. 

3
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:41,247
- Dad, there won't be any harvest? 
- No, there won't. 

4
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:02,305
- Bara? What are you doing, Bara? 
- I'm not doing anything. 

5
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,437
Were you going to cut down that tree? 

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,765
This is a protected forest, it' s 
forbidden! 

7
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:11,721
It got stuck when I was walking! 

8
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,432
- Hello, girls, how are you? 
- Fine, thanks. 

9
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:15,776
- How's your health? 
- Fine, thanks. 

10
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:17,666
Bara wants to cut down this tree. 

11
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:20,088
No, he doesn't. 
Bara doesn't want to cut down trees. 

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,120
Bara would never do that. 

13
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:23,222
Bara would never do that. 

14
00:01:32,722 --> 00:01:35,416
That's Bissine's forest, and it's all been 
cut down. 

15
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,487
Oh, there's a big hole in the forest! 

16
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,513
It looks like they've left the edges of 
the forest... 

17
00:01:44,544 --> 00:01:46,099
... so that it doesn't show. 

18
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,318
But you can see it from the sky ! 

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,294
We have to show Bara. 

20
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:53,318
He wanted to cut down some trees in the 
forest this morning. 

21
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:54,996
I'll go and get it. 

22
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:03,615
Ah! You see, you're really going to cut 
down that tree! 

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,253
No, it wasn't me, I didn't do anything! 

24
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:08,880
Come on, I've got to show you something. 

25
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:18,232
We met a boy. 
His whole forest has been cut down! 

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,296
Wow, can they cut all that down with 
machetes? 

27
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:23,475
No, with bulldozers. 

28
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:27,960
So it's not the same. Me, with my machete, 
it won't be noticeable. 

29
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:31,811
You're wrong. With a bulldozer, it goes 
faster... 

30
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:35,741
...but with a machete you can make ancient 
trees disappear too . 

31
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:36,936
And that's how it becomes? 

32
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:42,147
Yes. In my village, there are no animals 
left and the wells are dry. 

33
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:46,006
I understand why you had to leave your 
village. 

34
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:50,992
Our well is dry too. Everyone uses wood 
and charcoal to cook. 

35
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:52,882
They have to. 

36
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:56,773
Are you cutting down trees to sell 
charcoal ?
