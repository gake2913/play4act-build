1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,040
We arrived in Germany.
I'm exhausted.

2
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:08,800
What a migration.

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:13,880
Look, I found us a great pigeon hotel.

4
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:17,440
Look at everything there is.

5
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:22,000
Quickly, I turn on the oven
to heat some seeds.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,760
Look at the German countryside.

7
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:29,080
It's beautiful.

8
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:34,320
There are even wind turbines
that produce renewable energy.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,520
Oh, look, we can make milkshakes.

10
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,720
Oh, a popcorn machine.

11
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:43,560
I'm going to take a shower, too.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Look at this giant TV.

13
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:53,640
I'm going to put some
heat on for my shower.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,840
Hugo, stop.

15
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:01,280
Turn off the devices.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,960
You do not realise.

17
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:09,920
To operate all of these devices,
you have to produce energy.

18
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,520
But you told me they used wind turbines.
They work with the wind.

19
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:17,080
It's an energy that never disappears.

20
00:01:17,163 --> 00:01:19,240
But that's just part of it.

21
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:24,360
In Germany, renewable energies
represent 44%, which is less than half.

22
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:28,240
But I can't only turn on half of the TV.

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,080
In the In the world,
renewable energies only represent 20%.

24
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:37,880
This means that for the vast
majority, we use fossil fuels

25
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:40,640
which took millions of years to create.

26
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:43,120
Like oil, gas?

27
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:47,640
Yes, and they release a lot
of greenhouse gases when we use them.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,000
Is that what's making our planet hot?

29
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:56,440
What if we went to see a country
that uses 100% renewable energy?

30
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:58,120
It exists.
