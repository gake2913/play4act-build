1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,950
You could have warned me that
we were going to do 2000 kilometres.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,190
Well, Iceland is definitely not next door.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,470
All the more reason to warn.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,000
I was wrong.

5
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:15,830
I took a room without a TV.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,500
Quick, we have to go again.

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:21,670
Wait, what if we made board games instead?

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,083
It's fun, and what's more,
it doesn't use electricity.

9
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:30,360
We actually came here because Iceland

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,920
Is a country that only produces

11
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:40,917
its electricity with renewable energies.

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,030
They don't burn oil?
Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,590
They don't burn gas?

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,950
Mm-mm.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,030
But I don't even see any wind turbines.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,270
How do they do it?

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,910
Iceland is a country
with many mountains and rivers.

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,710
As a result, they produce 73% of
their electricity with hydropower plants.

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,870
To create electricity,
it's always the same thing.

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,590
You have to succeed in turning a turbine.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,280
The dam sends water down
the mountain in a long tight.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,000
The water arrives so quick
that it turns the turbine upon arrival.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,790
And since the river always brings water.

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,880
That's why we say it's a renewable energy.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,430
For the rest, they use
heat from the ground.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,550
It's called geothermal energy.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,830
Deep down, the ground is warm.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,480
As a result, they send the water deep.

29
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:35,910
It heats naturally and comes up very
hot, sometimes in steam.

30
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,390
This water, naturally heated
by our planet, becomes steam.

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,200
It rises so quickly that it also turns
a turbine which produces electricity.

32
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,070
But Iceland is a small country.

33
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,310
There are only 370,000 inhabitants.

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,070
Electric needs are low.

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,510
It must be easier to do
without fossil fuels.

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,710
It's true, and not all
countries can have dams.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,950
Maybe residents also need
to change their habits.

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,510
That's to say, now?

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,400
Quick, let's go back to Germany.
But we didn't sleep.
