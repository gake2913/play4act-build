1
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:07,390
Here we are, back in Germany.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,560
My favourite room.

3
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:17,667
You see, Mori, progress, modernity,
what differentiates us from the caveman?

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,400
That's it.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,917
What if we turned off the TV
to reduce electricity?

6
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:33,950
Oh, no.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,333
Don't take away the TV.

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,110
Oh, you saw.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,917
It had a positive impact.

10
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:46,430
Great.
Here we go for a world without TV.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,833
Your world is going to be great, Maury.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,583
Because you didn't like the
board game night we had in Iceland.

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,500
Oh, yes.
We had a lot of fun.

14
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:03,360
I'm not saying we should remove the TV,
but not leaving it on when you're not

15
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:08,270
looking at it and reducing
its use is already interesting.

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,070
Oh, I have another idea.

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,470
How about you wear a sweater?

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,680
What if we turn down the heating
and we could take shorter showers

19
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:24,250
to use less hot water?

20
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,910
No, that's too much.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,630
Welcome to the Middle Ages.

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,790
Your ideas make me depressed.

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
But are you cold?

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,640
No.

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,870
So what's the problem?

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,160
Well, the colour.

27
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:40,800
I don't like the colour of the sweater.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,167
We can find you another one.

29
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:47,670
But It's true that it works.

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,440
Could we also instal better
insulated windows to reduce

31
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:52,840
the energy need for heating?

32
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,083
We could also get around
a lot more on a bike or on foot.

33
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,390
That's better.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,790
Okay, it's becoming a world
that makes you want to.

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,714
Basically, on the one hand, we
must develop renewable energies and on

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,790
the other hand, reduce our consumption.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,230
Without this, it will become depressing.
Exactly.

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,470
For me, it's more a polluted world
that makes me depressed.

39
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,120
Oh, I still have lots of ideas
for reducing energy consumption.
