1
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:10,400
Oh, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.

2
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:12,560
Landing is more complicated here.

3
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:15,480
This is where our investigation begins.

4
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:19,208
Look, an empty tree.

5
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:25,400
All its inhabitants disappeared.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,040
But no, they must be at home.

7
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:37,680
Is there anyone?
Hello?

8
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,480
Who?

10
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:43,120
Yes.

11
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:46,600
You see, what did I tell you?

12
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:48,680
Hello, excuse me.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,680
Where has everyone else gone?

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,560
It's just me left, I'm afraid.

15
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:57,400
But how is that possible?

16
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:00,360
All this empty houses,
it gives you goosebumps.

17
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:05,542
You know, babies are always
born in the same period.

18
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:10,160
During spring, with all its births,

19
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:15,320
it's when birds need food the most.
Catcatapillar's.

20
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:16,800
Exactly.

21
00:01:16,883 --> 00:01:23,800
So far, the caterpillar season
matched the birth season.

22
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:27,680
But the climate is changing,
becoming milder.

23
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:31,458
The caterpillar season
has moved up by one week.

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,000
This results in a lack
of food for the birds.

25
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,277
No, but those caterpillas
are overdoing it.

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,240
Changing everything because
they prefer the weather this way

27
00:01:40,323 --> 00:01:43,400
or that way, that's not right.
You weren't listening.

28
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,360
The weather is another thing.

29
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:47,760
It's something that changes very quickly.

30
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:49,840
One day, it's raining.

31
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:52,280
One day, it's sunny.

32
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,880
One day, it rains.

33
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:55,320
Yes, well, that's okay.

34
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:57,560
He said climate, not weather.

35
00:01:57,643 --> 00:02:01,560
On the other hand, climate
is something that lasts for years,

36
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:04,560
even hundreds of years.

37
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:07,517
On our planet, there are
several different climate zones.

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
Hey, that's true.
Why isn't it the same everywhere?

39
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:13,040
There are several reasons.

40
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:19,240
The first is because our Earth
is round, so the sun's rays does not

41
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:21,120
reach everywhere in the same way.

42
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:23,167
Let's take the equator.

43
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:29,440
Look, it's the closest place
to the sun, and the rays are focused.

44
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:32,960
Lots of rain, very warm
temperatures all year round.

45
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:37,680
However, if we go a bit up,
there's an aride climate.

46
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:42,400
Hardly any rain, but still very hot.

47
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,840
Right at the top, the polar climate.

48
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:53,120
Here, the sun rays spread up and
become weaker, so it can be really cold.

49
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:59,680
Okay, there are various climates, but that
doesn't explain why they're changing.

50
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,360
No, it is really like that.

51
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:04,520
Maybe something is interacting
with the sun's rays.

52
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:07,520
But who would have the power to do that?

53
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:13,280
I don't want to interfere in what doesn't
concern me, but the atmosphere

54
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:16,160
can influence the sun's rays.

55
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:17,280
Not wrong.

56
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,800
Quick to the cannon.
