1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:05,616
Highly Migratory Species

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,172
Oh! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

3
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:13,359
Landing is more... complicated.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,547
This is where our investigation begins!

5
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:17,969
Look at that!

6
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:19,821
A... tree?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,530
An empty tree!

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,023
All its inhabitants have...

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,376
disappeared.

10
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:27,993
No !

11
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,258
They must be, uh...

12
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:30,259
at home!

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,055
Is there anyone in here?

14
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:36,329
Hey ho!

15
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:39,719
Hello?

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,860
Yuhu!

17
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:42,861
Yes?

18
00:00:42,862 --> 00:00:43,862
What is it for?

19
00:00:43,863 --> 00:00:44,863
You know?

20
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:46,465
What did I tell you?

21
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:47,938
Hello.

22
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,422
Excuse me, but,

23
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:51,251
what happened to everyone else?

24
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:53,665
Ha, it’s just me!

25
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:55,422
I’m afraid so.

26
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:57,641
But how is that possible?

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,188
All those empty houses,

28
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:00,189
it...

29
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,305
it gives you goosebumps.

30
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:03,055
You know,

31
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,727
babies are always born
 at the same time:

32
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:07,742
During the spring!

33
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:09,719
With all these births

34
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,422
this is the moment when the birds
need food the most.

35
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:15,719
Caterpillars?

36
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,282
Exactly!

37
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:20,063
So far,
the caterpillar period

38
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:23,571
corresponding to the period of birth.

39
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:25,085
But

40
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,868
the climate is changing!

41
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:28,834
By becoming softer,

42
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:32,069
the caterpillar period
has advanced by a week!

43
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,945
This leads to a lack of food

44
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:36,414
for the birds!

45
00:01:36,415 --> 00:01:37,963
No, but they abuse the caterpillars!

46
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,696
Change everything because they
prefer a weather

47
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,025
like this,
or a weather like that!

48
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:42,026
You can’t do that!

49
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:43,432
You did not listen,

50
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:45,643
The weather is something else!

51
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:47,487
This is something that changes very quickly!

52
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:48,917
One day it rains,

53
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:51,284
One day it’s nice!

54
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:53,893
- One day it rains,

55
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,080
- Yes, it’s okay!

56
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,282
He said climate, not weather!

57
00:01:58,587 --> 00:01:59,587
Conversely,

58
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:02,306
the climate is something
that lasts for years,

59
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:04,040
see hundreds of years!

60
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:05,697
On our planet,

61
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:07,588
there are several different climates.

62
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:10,126
Here, this is true:
Why isn’t it the same everywhere?

63
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,659
There are several reasons,

64
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,909
the first is because our
Earth is round.

65
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,119
As a result,

66
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,525
the rays of the sun,

67
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:19,651
don’t happen everywhere

68
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:20,894
in the same way.

69
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,073
Let’s take the equator,

70
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:24,503
look,

71
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:26,917
It’s the closest place to the sun.

72
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:29,120
And the rays are concentrated.

73
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,651
We find the climate,

74
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,385
Um, equatorial?

75
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,550
That’s what it is!

76
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:37,347
A lot of rain,
a very hot temperature,

77
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:38,558
all year long!

78
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,932
On the other hand, if we go a little higher:

79
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:42,986
We have a dry climate.

80
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:44,893
Almost never rain,

81
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:47,033
but still very hot.

82
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:49,095
What the hell is going on?
I am... I am...

83
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:50,456
thirsty!

84
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,643
And at the top:

85
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:53,361
the polar climate.

86
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:54,432
Here,

87
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,885
beams spread out

88
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:57,526
and become less strong.

89
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,213
So it can get really cold.

90
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,931
Especially since these are the places
the furthest

91
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,409
with the sun.

92
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:07,909
We can go back to a climate
continental?

93
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:12,135
Oh, thank you! Okay, there are several climates.

94
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:14,119
But that doesn’t explain

95
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,658
why they are changing.

96
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,018
No, that is true!

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,487
Maybe something
changes the sun’s rays.

98
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:23,206
Meh, but who would have
the power to change that?

99
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:24,721
I don’t want to meddle,

100
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:26,346
of what is none of my business,

101
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:29,766
but the atmosphere can influence

102
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:32,141
the rays of the sun.

103
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,758
Not wrong!

104
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,266
Hurry!
To the cannon!

105
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:40,266
