1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,480
Yes, I am the first.
No, no.

2
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:10,120
Oh, this can't be true.

3
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:11,600
So why are we here?

4
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:16,240
To find the source of greenhouse gases.
Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:20,200
Do you think we'll find any?

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,520
Actually, that could be it.

7
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:23,960
Okay.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,760
So I found the first source.

9
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:29,600
The car.

10
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:36,120
One way could to ride a bike
more often or use public transport.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,708
What you need to know is carbon
is also a natural cycle.

12
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:51,280
It enters and leaves the atmosphere
constantly.

13
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:57,760
The oceans, for example, they are
large carbon storages, forests as well

14
00:00:57,843 --> 00:01:00,520
as the soil, and of course, Yes.

15
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:03,500
Everyone releases carbon
into the atmosphere.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,440
But seriously,
there's still big pollutants.

17
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:09,080
No, because nature is perfect.

18
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:16,080
The oceans, forests, and soil also store
carbon, and in the end, it balances out.

19
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,840
It's a cycle.

20
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:22,542
That ensures there's always a bit
of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.

21
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,125
Remember, we need it.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,240
And voila.

23
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:31,360
Let me introduce my new factory
for making super modern, ultra trendy,

24
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:32,880
extremely high tech products.

25
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:34,625
And how do we write that now?

26
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:39,720
But no, your factory needs energy,
so it surely burns oil.

27
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:43,720
Yes, but like I told you,
she makes such great stuff.

28
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,320
Well, I'm not sure We need that.

29
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:48,360
Don't count on me to buy them.

30
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,208
I have an idea.

31
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:55,960
They say trees are carbon sinks,
meaning they can store more.

32
00:01:56,043 --> 00:02:00,080
If I add trees, that balances out.

33
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:05,440
But why are you doing that?

34
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:08,800
The workers of my factory are hungry.

35
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:13,792
I need space to grow grain,
and I also keep cattle for meat.

36
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:17,400
But now, the balance is totally off.

37
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:21,000
The trees you cut down
no longer absorb carbon.

38
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,375
When they die, they even release some.

39
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,240
Oh, and look at the oxen.
They have flatulence.

40
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:33,360
The livestock release methane,
another greenhouse gas.

41
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:38,167
Look, that disturbs the balance.

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,920
The packaging.
Yes.

43
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:48,480
A lot of energy and resources
are needed to make packaging.

44
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:51,000
This naturally has a carbon impact.

45
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:55,667
So we should choose products
with as little packaging as possible.

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,400
Oh, look, French cheese.
Wait.

47
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,280
Did you test it?

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,920
We're in the USA,
but this cheese is from France.

49
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:09,360
It has travelled thousands
of kilometres, just like us.

50
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:12,160
No, but he might have hitchhiked.

51
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,600
More likely by plane or a big ship.

52
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:18,167
Very environmentally harmful
means of prompting.

53
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,720
Should we eat products
that come from nearby?

54
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:25,400
We need to hurry back to France to tell
the others everything we've discovered.
