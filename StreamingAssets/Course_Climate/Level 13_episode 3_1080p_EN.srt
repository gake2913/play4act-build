1
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:06,797
Yes, first!

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:07,977
No, no.

3
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:09,469
But you’re too fast!

4
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:11,617
Well, why are we here?

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,562
To find the source

6
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:15,242
greenhouse gases.

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,195
Ah yes, because you think that here
we’re gonna find some...

8
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:20,211
Ahh, kof, kof, kof!

9
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:21,664
Indeed,

10
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:22,938
this could be it!

11
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,133
Kof!

12
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:25,375
Okay,

13
00:00:25,376 --> 00:00:27,251
well I found the first source:

14
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:29,000
The car.

15
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:30,586
A solution

16
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:33,023
would be to ride more the bike

17
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,781
or take more public transport.

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,719
What you need to know,

19
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:41,172
is that the carbon,

20
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,461
it’s also a natural cycle.

21
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:47,703
it enters the atmosphere,
then leaves the atmosphere

22
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:48,984
all the time.

23
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:51,007
The oceans for example,

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,648
these are big carbon reversers,

25
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:55,250
forests too,

26
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:56,500
just like the ground.

27
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,297
And they all naturally release carbon

28
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:01,906
atmospheric.

29
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:02,973
Ah but seriously?

30
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:04,820
But they’re big polluters
all the same!

31
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:07,337
No, because nature is well made.

32
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:10,274
Oceans, forests and ground,

33
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:12,306
also capture carbon,

34
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:14,642
and in the end, it balances.

35
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,040
That’s the way it is!

36
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:20,064
It always gives you a little
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

37
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,614
Remember,

38
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:22,942
we need it!

39
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:24,794
Hey, hop on it!

40
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:26,356
Meet my new factory

41
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:28,239
to make too modern objects

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,849
top-trend, hyper high-tech.

43
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:32,606
And now it’s still balancing?

44
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,575
But no, your plant needs power,
so it’s probably burning oil!

45
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:39,567
Yeah, but like I said,

46
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,637
She makes things too well.

47
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,191
Yeah, not sure we need it.

48
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,856
Don’t count on me to buy them!

49
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:48,427
I have an idea!

50
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,833
They say that trees are
carbon sinks,

51
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:53,161
that is, they can
store more.

52
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:55,709
So if I add trees:

53
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,927
Hop, it balances out!

54
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:03,396
Why are you doing this?

55
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,028
The workers in my factory are hungry!

56
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,685
I need space
to grow cereal!

57
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,122
And I also want beef for meat.

58
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:15,396
Well, it doesn’t balance out at all!

59
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:18,489
The trees you cut
no longer absorb carbon,

60
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:21,396
and besides, when they die,
They let them go!

61
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:25,293
oh and look at the oxen, they have gas!

62
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,692
The cattle are releasing methane,

63
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,043
another greenhouse gas.

64
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:34,809
With all this, the balance is broken.

65
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:40,051
Mhhh, the packages.

66
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,293
And yes!

67
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,153
It takes a lot of energy and
resources to manufacture packaging

68
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:48,621
It must have a carbon impact.

69
00:02:48,778 --> 00:02:51,598
So you have to choose as much as possible
things without packaging.

70
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,028
Oh look! French cheese!

71
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:58,231
Wait, you tested it?

72
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:03,848
This is the United States,
but this cheese comes from France!

73
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:06,614
Like us,
He’s gone thousands of miles!

74
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,754
No, but maybe he hitched a ride.

75
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:13,125
More like a plane, or a big boat!

76
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:15,203
Very polluting transports!

77
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:19,132
Oh, so you have to eat products
coming from near home?

78
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:20,710
Yes! We must quickly return to France

79
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,062
tell others everything
what we just discovered!

80
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,070
