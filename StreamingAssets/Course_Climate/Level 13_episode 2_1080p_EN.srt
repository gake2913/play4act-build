1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,880
Oh, you're here already.

2
00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:08,557
You wanted to show me mountain
climate, didn't you?

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,560
No.

4
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:13,477
We've come to the top of this mountain
to observe the atmosphere.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,720
So yes, I'll give you that.

6
00:00:14,803 --> 00:00:17,880
The view is amazing, but I see nothing.

7
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:19,360
Your atmosphere isn't there.

8
00:00:19,443 --> 00:00:23,080
You got it wrong, Maury.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,640
A diving suit.

10
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:29,960
But we're in the mountains,
not at the sea.

11
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:44,120
And now, do you see it?

12
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:46,600
Your atmosphere Is it a fear?
Negative.

13
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:48,560
I can't see anything at all.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,375
Oh, really?
Okay, go ahead.

15
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,560
Take off your helmet.

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,200
But there's no oxygen here.
Oh, really?

17
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:03,640
Really?
And the temperature.

18
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:14,000
Even at night,
it's not that cold on Earth.

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,920
The atmosphere isn't visible.

20
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:20,440
It's gases.

21
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:26,680
It's oxygen that you're breathing,
for example, but also a lot of nitrogen,

22
00:01:26,763 --> 00:01:33,600
carbon dioxide, and water vapour,
on the moon, there's hardly

23
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:37,960
any atmosphere, unlike here.

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,200
Oh, your glasses are amazing, Maury.

25
00:01:44,283 --> 00:01:47,840
Now look, The Sun's rays warm our planet.

26
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:53,520
The atmosphere reflects a quarter
of the rays and absorbs another quarter.

27
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:58,280
So only half reaches our ground
and the oceans to warm them.

28
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:03,120
It's very important because it prevents
the soil and oceans from freezing.

29
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:04,720
There'd be no life otherwise.

30
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:10,960
Then the ground and the oceans
lets this heat escape back to space.

31
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:13,640
But the atmosphere holds onto some of it.

32
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:18,280
By holding onto this When you eat,
the atmosphere acts like a greenhouse,

33
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:21,757
like when you want to grow veggies
and keep them from getting cold.

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,397
But that's what's called
the greenhouse effect.

35
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,560
Here you go.

36
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:27,800
A natural and mandatory effect for life.

37
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:32,480
Otherwise, we'd all be Well,
like your feet for that matter.

38
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:35,720
Everything seems to work fine,
at least better than on the moon.

39
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:39,440
Basically, it's like a big air conditioner
to regulate temperatures.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,083
So where's the problem?

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,080
Butter?
Is that for sandwiches?

42
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,583
Great idea.
But No, look.

43
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:52,560
I put both in the sunlight,
but over one, I place a glass bowl.

44
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:56,040
It's like increasing
the atmosphere's thickness.

45
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:58,560
And the temperature rises?

46
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:04,280
Like I told you, the atmosphere,
it's gas, but it's the same.

47
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:09,200
If we increase the gases,
the atmosphere becomes thicker,

48
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:12,292
and so the greenhouse effect increases.

49
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:17,250
But who would benefit from
sending more gas into the atmosphere?

50
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,583
Maybe I have an idea.

51
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,040
Okay, quick, to the cannon.
