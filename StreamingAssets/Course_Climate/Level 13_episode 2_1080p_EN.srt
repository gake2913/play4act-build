1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,211
Oh!

2
00:00:03,477 --> 00:00:05,022
You are here yet?

3
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:08,226
Bruh, you wanted to show me
the mountain climate, is that it?

4
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:11,712
But no, we came up
of this mountain to observe

5
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:13,367
the atmosphere!

6
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:16,336
So, yes, I grant you,
the view is superb,

7
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:18,852
but I can’t see anything.

8
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,904
Your atmosphere is not there.
You were wrong, Mori!

9
00:00:24,787 --> 00:00:27,428
A diving suit, but we’re in the mountains,
not to the sea.

10
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:42,701
And now you see your atmosphere?

11
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:44,131
Negative,

12
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:45,310
I can’t see anything.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,455
This really isn’t your day, Mori.

14
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:48,947
Oh yeah?

15
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,619
Okay, go ahead, take off your helmet!

16
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:59,236
But there’s no oxygen here!

17
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:00,830
Well, well.

18
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:02,664
And what about the temperature?

19
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:08,993
But I don’t understand!

20
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:10,970
Even at night it doesn’t
as icy on...

21
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,158
on earth!

22
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:13,580
In fact,

23
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:15,603
the atmosphere is not visible.

24
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:17,057
This is gas!

25
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,510
It’s the oxygen,

26
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,517
ah,

27
00:01:19,518 --> 00:01:21,135
that you breathe, for example!

28
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:23,111
But also a lot of nitrogen,

29
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,783
carbon dioxide,

30
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:25,784
ho there,

31
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:27,221
and water vapour.

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,611
On the Moon,

33
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:30,385
there is almost no atmosphere!

34
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:31,971
Unlike here.

35
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:41,182
Ho-ho, your glasses are amazing.

36
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:42,533
Now look at this.

37
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,580
The sun’s rays are coming
heat our planet

38
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:48,260
the atmosphere returns
a quarter of the rays,

39
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,322
and absorbs another quarter.

40
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:53,587
So there’s only half
that reaches our soil

41
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:55,307
and the oceans to warm them.

42
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:56,971
This is very important because

43
00:01:56,972 --> 00:02:00,166
this allows the land and oceans not to
be frozen.

44
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:01,885
There would be no life otherwise.

45
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:03,728
Then,

46
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,721
soil and oceans let go
this heat to space.

47
00:02:08,182 --> 00:02:10,517
But the atmosphere retains a part.

48
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,642
Holding back this heat,

49
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:15,182
the atmosphere acts as a sphere.

50
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:17,283
Like when you want to grow
of vegetables,

51
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,103
and don’t get cold.

52
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:21,104
Ah but that’s what we call
the greenhouse effect!

53
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:22,144
There you go!

54
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:25,363
A natural and mandatory effect
for life.

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,199
Otherwise we’d be, ha!

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,910
Well, your feet are holding!

57
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:32,683
Huh huh, it all looks like
to function well.

58
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:34,480
Better than on the moon.

59
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:37,441
Basically, it’s like a big air conditioner
to regulate the temperature.

60
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,277
Well, what’s the problem?

61
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:44,261
Butter? ls that for sandwiches?
Great idea!

62
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:46,066
No, look at that!

63
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:48,113
I put both in the sun:

64
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:49,550
but above one,

65
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:51,355
I put a glass bowl.

66
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:54,839
It’s like I’m increasing
the thickness of the atmosphere.

67
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:57,495
Hun hun, and the temperature is rising.

68
00:02:57,746 --> 00:02:59,010
Just like I told you.

69
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,351
The atmosphere

70
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:01,406
they are gases

71
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:02,750
but it’s the same.

72
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:05,468
If we increase the gas,

73
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:07,147
the atmosphere becomes

74
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:08,484
thicker!

75
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,976
And so the greenhouse effect

76
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:11,164
increase!

77
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:15,898
But who would be interested
in sending more gas into the atmosphere?

78
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:18,773
Um, maybe I have an idea.

79
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:20,133
So quick, to the cannon!

80
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,850
